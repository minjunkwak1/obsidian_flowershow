## 1 What is Better Notes
Better Notes is an extension of Zotero's built-in note function.
Zotero's note is much like a markdown/rich-text editor. You can edit the format with the tools above⬆️.
### 1.1 Workspace Window
The knowledge workspace window contains an outline area(left side⬅️), the main note area, and the preview area(right side➡️).
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51)">|---------------||----------------||----------------|</span>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51)">|                  ||                  ||                  |</span>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51)">|    Outline    ||  Main Note  ||   Preview    |</span>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51)">|                  ||                  ||                  |</span>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51)">|------------ --||---------------||----------------|</span>
Open workspace by clicking the 'Open Workspace' line above the 'My Library' line in Zotero main window. Alternatively, open it with the <span style="background-color: #ffd40080">'🏠home' button</span> on the top-left of note editors.
Most functions are integrated in the upper left menu bar of the workspace window (in MacOS, the upper left of the screen), which will be described in subsequent chapters.
### 1.2 Main note
This addon uses a Zotero note item as the main note. It will show up on the main area of the workspace window.
All links will be added to the main note.
Click <span style="background-color: #ffd40080">File -> Open Main Note</span> in the workspace window to select a note as the main note.
## 2 Gather Ideas to Main Note
